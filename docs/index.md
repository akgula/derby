DerbyJS is a full-stack framework for writing modern web applications.

# Realtime collaboration

Effortlessly sync data across clients and servers with automatic conflict resolution powered by ShareDB's operational transformation of JSON and text.

# Server and client rendering

Templates can be rendered in the browser and on the server. In a browser, DerbyJS renders with fast, native DOM methods.

On the server, no DOM or virtual DOM implementation is needed â€” the same templates return HTML as well! HTML rendering means faster page loads, full search engine support, and ability to use the same templates for all types of HTML output, such as emails.
